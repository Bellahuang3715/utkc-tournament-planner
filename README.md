<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The Kendo Tournament Planner is a web application developed to address current gaps in organizing and managing kendo tournaments. This project, currently in its design and early development stages, was initiated through a partnership with the University of Toronto (UofT) Kendo Club to help streamline the current tournament planning workflow for their annual tournament, which hosts 300+ participants. The app will:

1) automate bracket generation using custom criteria
2) integrate a user-friendly interface for dynamic score input, and 
3) support real-time collaboration with a centralized history,

thereby reducing human errors and bias, significantly improving the experience for organizers, participants, and spectators alike. The UofT Kendo Club executive team (the client) is actively involved in defining and refining project requirements and specifications, ensuring the application meets the unique needs of large-scale tournament management.
